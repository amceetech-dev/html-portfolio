    <h3>Squid Game</h3>
    <p>
      Korean Drama "Squid Game" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful. It has a nice
      cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action
      scenes.
    </p>
    <h3>One Piece</h3>
    <p>
      it's an uplifting yet dramatic story in an inventive world that runs
      towards optimism. Luffy (Inaki Godoy) is a force of nature.
    </p>
    <h3>The Equalizer</h3>
    <p>
      a retired operative decides to intervene in helping a young prostitute by
      demolishing the criminal network
